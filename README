# Fizzbuzz

This is a fun practice problem in all the different programming languages I know

## Rules

1) Loop through the numbers 1-100
2) If a number is divisible by 3, print "fizz"
3) If a number is divisible by 7, print "buzz"
4) If a number is divisible by both 3 and 7, print "fizzbuzz"
5) Otherwise, print the number
